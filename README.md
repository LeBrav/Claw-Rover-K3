# Claw-Rover-K3
Project of a programmed and simulated robot that drives autonomously and collects garbage.

In this project you will find the code, simulations and 3D designs of the parts of a robot developed from scratch, which is able to drive autonomously and collect garbage previously detected using computer vision techniques. This robot consists, schematically, of an anthropomorphic arm located on a platform with four wheels (front-wheel drive). It is implemented with Coppelia simulator and, in case you want to carry it out in real life, the instructions dedicated to the movement of the simulation robot should be substituted by communication instructions from a Raspberry Pi board to an Arduino board. This is a necessary step in order to correctly interact with the hardware components of the robot, such as the wheels, the arm or the sensors.
